The Scottish Highlands is the last remaining true wilderness in the UK. Home to the highest mountains, largest lochs and most stunning scenery, the surroundings are to be explored whether you are a cyclist, a walker, or just driving.

A selection of activities and unmissable areas to be experienced within one hour travel of Old Pines:

* [Loch Ness](http://www.lochness.com/)
* [Ben Nevis](http://ben-nevis.com/)
* [Aonach Mor / the Nevis Range](https://www.nevisrange.co.uk/)
* [Caledonian Canal](https://www.scottishcanals.co.uk/canals/caledonian-canal/)
* [Great Glen Way](https://www.highland.gov.uk/greatglenway/)
* [Mallaig](https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/mallaig/mallaig/index.html)
* [Arisaig](https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/arisaig/arisaig/index.html)
* [Road to the Isles](https://www.road-to-the-isles.org.uk/)

We have our very own walk across the road from the hotel. The [Highbridge Circular walk](https://www.wildlochaber.com/spean-bridge/walking/high-bridge-and-commando-memorial) takes in the old Highbridge ruins, the site of Jacobite rebellion, the remains of the abandoned Gairlochy to Fort Augustus railway, the Commando Memorial, and the dramatic Spean Gorge. An hour and a half of easy, mostly-flat walking is the perfect way to rejuvenate the body, relax the mind, and work up an appetite for [dinner]([root]restaurant/).

Welcome to Old Pines. We are a small hotel and restaurant set in seven acres of ancient Scots pine trees just north of Spean Bridge, near Fort William, in the Scottish Highlands with spectacular view of the Ben Nevis Range.

Indulge in freshly-prepared, locally-sourced food, a restful atmosphere in rejuvenating Highland air.
